o Getting data by path and media type/ posting data
```

```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 11. What are the differences between SOAP and REST?
```
- Architecture:
o SOAP: XML-based message protocol
o REST: architectural style
- Communication:
o SOAP: WSDL
o REST: XML + JSON (WADL)
- Invocation:
o SOAP: RPC method
o REST: URL path
- Returned result:
o SOAP: doesn’t return human readable
o REST: return human readable (XML + JSON)
- Protocol:
o SOAP: HTTP, SMTP, FTP…
o REST: HTTP
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 12. What is JAX-RS, and why did you use it ?
```
- Java API for RESTful webservice
- Support to create RESTful webservice
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 13. What JAX-RS implementation did you use ?
```
- Jersey
- Spring MVC
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 14. Could you explain about WADL?
```
- Web Application Description Language
- Machine-readable XML of HTTP-based web application
- Models resources, relationship, methods applied, representation format
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 15. Have you worked with consuming or producing Web Service?
```
- Both
- Jersey Client + Jersey
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 16. Can you explain about WSDL?
```
- Webservice Description Language
- XML-based interface for describing function
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 17. What are different states of object in Hibernate?
```
- Transient: not associated with persistence context
- Persistence: associated with persistence context
- Detached: not associated with because persistence context is closed
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 18. What is the meaning of the Controller annotation?
```
- To identify that class acts as a controller
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 19. What is Spring?

```
- Lightweight
- IOC
- AOP
- Container
- MVC
- Transaction management
- JDBC Exception Handling
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 21. What is IOC? Dependency Injection?
```
- IOC:
o Inversion of Control
o Invert control of creating object from new operator to container 
- DI:
o Dependency Injection
o Implementation of IOC
o All dependencies of an object are injected into it by framework
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 22. What is AOP?
```
- Aspect Oriented Programming
- Modularizes cross-cutting concerns (logging, security, transaction management..)
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 23. Explain Aspect, Advice, Joint Point, Pointcut?
```
- Aspect:
o a modularization of a concern
o cuts across multiple classes
o Eg: transaction management
- Join point:
o a point during the execution of a program
o in Spring AOP: represents a method execution
- Advice:
o action taken by an aspect at a particular join point
o Different types: around, before and after advice
- Pointcut:
o Collection of Joint Points
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 24. What are different types of DI?

```
- Constructor injection
- Setter injection
- Interface injection
- Spring support Constructor Injection & Setter Injection
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 25 What are the benefits of DI?
```
- Minimize amount of code
- Make application more testable
- Loose coupling
- Eager instatiation + lazy loading
- Flexible, security
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 26. Could you decribe the life cycle of Spring beans?
```
- Bean Container finds definition of bean
- Create a instance of bean
- Depending on the interface, the properties of the bean ->  setter method will be called
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 27. What is BeanFactory?
```
- Base on Factory pattern and IOC design
- Support 2 bean scopes: singleton + prototype
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 28. What is ApplicationContext? What is the different between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?
```
- ApplicationContext  Derives from BeanFactory
- Has all functionality of BeanFactory + support:
o Internationalization messsages
o Many enterprise service(EJB, JNDI…) 
o Access to resource (URL + file)
o Application life-cycle events
o Publish events to bean registered as listenter
o Loading mutiple context
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 29. How many types of bean scopes supported  by Spring? And explain them.
```
- 5 types:
o Singleton: default scope of Spring, 1 object instance per Spring container
o Prototype: new object is created + returned whenever you get the bean
o Request: new object for each HTTP request
o Session: new session is created -> new instance object of bean
o Global session: same as HTTP session scope, applicable in portlet-based web app
```
